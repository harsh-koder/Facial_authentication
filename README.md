#  Facial recognition authentication

Facial recognition has become a popular authentication technique among developers in recent years, and for good reason. With facial recognition, users can log in to web applications without the hassle of entering their email-password or other user credentials. This authentication system is fast, convenient, and doesn't require any special hardware; most devices already have a webcam.

Facial recognition technology uses artificial intelligence to create a unique map of a user's facial details, which is then stored as a hash to protect user privacy. However, building and deploying an artificial intelligence-based face recognition model from scratch can be difficult and expensive, especially for small startups and indie developers. That's where SaaS platforms like FaceIO and AWS Recognition come in handy, as they can do all the heavy-lifting for you.

In this hands-on project, we will be using FaceIO APIs to implement facial recognition authentication in a React web application. With the help of the fio.js JavaScript library.
